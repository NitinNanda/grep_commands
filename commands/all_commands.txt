1) grep -winr "Any Text" sample.txt
    -w: searches for complete word
    -i: case in-sensitive
    -n: shows corresponding line number along with the search result in the search file
    -r: recursively searches in subdirectories as well. Must be careful while using as if the directory structure is large, it may take a lot of time to search
    
2) grep -winr "Any Text" ./*
    ./* searches the text in all files in the current directory
    
3) grep -winr "Any Text" ./*.csv
    ./* searches the text in all .csv files in the current directory
    
    when we are using the -r flag, we need not give ./* in the end

4) grep -winl "Any Text" ./*.csv
    -l: this will display distinct file paths that contains the matched search
    
5) grep -winc "Any Text" ./*.csv
    -c: this will display distinct file with the count of matched string
    
6) grep history
    shows recent history
    
6) grep history | "git commit"
    we can use pipe '|' to search within our history. In this case we are searching for the text "git commit"
    
7) grep history | "git commit" | "-m"
    we can use additional pipes '|' to search within our previous search. So it is like another search on the previous search results

8) grep -P "\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" sample.csv
    This will match for phone number in the format xxx-xxx-xxxx in the file. We can use other regex expression to search for other cases like (xxx)-xxx-xxxx
