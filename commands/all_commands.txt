1) grep -winr "Any Text" sample.txt
    -w: searches for complete word
    -i: case in-sensitive
    -n: shows corresponding line number along with the search result in the search file
    -r: recursively searches in subdirectories as well. Must be careful while using as if the directory structure is large, it may take a lot of time to search
    
2) grep -winr "Any Text" ./*
    ./* searches the text in all files in the current directory
    
3) grep -winr "Any Text" ./*.csv
    ./* searches the text in all .csv files in the current directory
    
    when we are using the -r flag, we need not give ./* in the end
